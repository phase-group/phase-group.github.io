# PHASE Group

**Phase-space Hamiltonian Astrophysical Systems & Evolution**

The PHASE Group focuses on the study of nonlinear dynamics in astrophysical
gravitational systems. Our research explores orbital motion, phase-space
structure, stability, and chaos in systems ranging from galactic potentials
to compact objects.

We combine analytical methods and numerical simulations to understand
the long-term evolution of trajectories in complex gravitational environments.
